## [Unreleased]
### Changed
- Ignore coverage artifacts generated by the test suite to keep working trees clean.
- Speed up compromised maintainer detection by indexing the dataset once at engine startup.
- Deduplicate dependencies before analysis and bound concurrent policy evaluations to protect upstream services.
- Surface actionable errors when unknown package managers are requested via the CLI.
- Expand unit coverage around scanner registry and CLI error handling.
- Precompile the HTML report template and eliminate duplicate JSON serialization for faster report generation.
- Validate CLI format switches via argparse and emit clearer errors for missing report files.
- Allow tuning trust-policy concurrency through the `RTX_POLICY_CONCURRENCY` environment variable and document the setting.
- Extend reporting unit tests to cover JSON/HTML rendering success and failure modes.
- Restore the console entry point so the published `rtx` script boots without import errors.
- Add comprehensive metadata fetcher tests backed by `httpx.MockTransport` fixtures.
- Relax dependency pins for `httpx` and `PyYAML` to stay compatible with downstream security baselines.
